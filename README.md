> While you're here, feel free to check out the main.js; It's got some kinda neat relatively modern JavaScript features. If you have ideas on a different data structure than Map, please share! Having to stringify to store in localStorage means calling Array.from() and the whole thing looks a little clunky to me. Thanks, and have a nice day!
